# Installation
The extension can be installed via the .xpi file. A very short video how-to and demo is here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1NbFu5EbIE.

# Other
If you would like to know what is in the .xpi file it is easy to find out. The .xpi file is a .zip file in diguise. Rename the .xpi file to .zip then unzip the file and you can view what the extension holds.
