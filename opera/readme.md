# Installation
## Linux
Use the .oex file to install. There is a very quick video demonstration on how to do this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNv8VAvO8Hc. At the time of writing the newest version of Opera for Linux is 12.16. I anticipate when this is updated this extension will no longer work.

## Windows
The Windows version is more up to date than the Linux version. At the time of writing the newest version is 17.0. In this newer version Opera uses the Chrome extension format. So, if you are using this newer version, 15+ (I think) use the .crx file in Chrome to install. There is a very quick video tutorial on how to do this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skzrrhp1AOI.

# Other
If you would like to know exactly what the .oex file contains do note that it is simply a .zip file in disguise. Rename the file to have a .zip extension and extract it. The same sort of thing is true for the Chrome extension.
