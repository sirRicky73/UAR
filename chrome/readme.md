# Installation

Use the .crx file to install the extension. If needed, check out this youtube video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMgkbGICBiE on how to do this.

This is also the extension for newer versions of Opera. At the time of writing, these versions are not available for Linux.

# Other

If you would like to know what you are installing for sure, the crx file is just a zip file in disguise. Rename the file to have a .zip extension and extract it and you can see the code.
